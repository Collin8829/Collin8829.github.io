<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Master's student at **[Technical University of Denmark]**, majoring in **[Electrical Engineering]**. 

My research interests center around **Speech & Auditory Signal Processing**, with a particular focus on the **Cocktail-Party Problem**—enabling machines to selectively attend to specific sound sources in noisy, multi-speaker environments. 

I have a broad passion for the **entire audio domain**. I am deeply interested in exploring how computational models can perceive, process, and understand sound in ways that mimic or surpass human auditory systems, ranging from speech enhancement to general audio event detection.
