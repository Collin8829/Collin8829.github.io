<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Master's student at **Technical University of Denmark**, majoring in **Electrical Engineering**. 

My research interests lie in **speech and auditory signal processing**, with a particular focus on the **Cocktail-Party Problem**, including **auditory attention decoding**, **speech separation**, **denoising**, and **target speaker extraction**. I am also interested in extending these directions toward **SpeechLLMS**.

I am broadly interested in **audio signal processing**, including perceptual and data-driven models for automotive audio system. This interest is motivated by my long-standing passion for music. I welcome academic and industrial collaborations via E-mail😊.
